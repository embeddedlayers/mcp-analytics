## First Analysis

Try this simple example:

```
"I have data at https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mwaskom/seaborn-data/master/tips.csv
Can you analyze what factors affect tip amounts using linear regression?"
```

MCP Analytics will:
1. Load the data
2. Run linear regression
3. Show you which factors matter most
4. Provide a shareable report

## Authentication

On first use, you'll be prompted to authenticate via Auth0. This is a one-time setup that:
- Secures your data
- Tracks your usage
- Enables report saving
